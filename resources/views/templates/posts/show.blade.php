                            <p class="post-full">
                                January is well underway. We've survived the holidays and had a bit of recovery time, which means it's time to start looking towards the future. What does 2016 hold for you and your business? How can you expect the marketing space to change in 2016?
                            </p>
                            <p class="post-full">
                                Digital marketing, as you definitely know, is ever-changing and rapidly adapts itself to new technology, new attitudes and new behaviors. As a marketer, you must always be aware of what's on the horizon to make sure you're prepared, with the best marketing strategy.
                            </p>
                            <p class="post-full">
                                Technology will have the largest impact on marketing efforts in the coming year. Whether it's video production (and consumption) or wearable gadgets, rapidly developing technology is set to break boundaries and push us all out of our comfort zones.
                            </p>

                                Don't know what to prepare for? Here are some digital marketing trends that are likely to dominate the marketing space in the new year.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="post-title">1. Visual SEO</h2>

                            <p class="post-full">
                                Optimizing your site for search engines is an ongoing and ever-evolving process. Google (and other search engines) are regularly tweaking their algorithms to ensure we  always find the best results.
                            </p>
                            <p class="post-full">
                                There is no doubt that the way we consume content has changed drastically in the past couple of years. Our attention spans have become increasingly limited and we are much more attracted to visual content such as photos, infographics and video over traditional plain text.
                            </p>
                            <p class="post-full">
                                While plain text will always be important, in 2016 it’s likely search engines will start to place even more importance on visual content, as that is what users want. According to this Demand Gen report, even the B2B audience is becoming increasingly interested in visual content when making purchase decisions.
                            </p>
                            <p class="post-full">
                                Engaging visual content means a user is likely to spend more time on your website. This is a good signal for search engines. Additionally, a site with more visual content is likely to start ranking better in search engines. If your visual content starts to appear in search results and users click through, you will get additional brownie points from Google for relevance.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="post-title">2. Video Domination </h2>

                            <p class="post-full">
                                Whether it’s Netflix, YouTube, Instagram, or even live streaming options such as Facebook Live and Periscope, video is going to dominate the visual content marketing and consumption space in 2016.
                            </p>
                            <p class="post-full">
                                In a Nielsen global survey of 30,000 respondents from 60 countries, 55% of respondents asserted that video programming is an important part of their lives. Whether it’s on mobiles, desktops or smart TVs, video, in its many forms, is well loved by the average internet user.
                            </p>
                            <p class="post-full">

                                It’s also important to note that mobile video plays a huge role in video consumption. For Millennials and Generation Z, mobile is very often the primary or the secondary device for video. For out-of-home video consumption, mobile is the primary device of choice for all generations. I’ll talk about mobile in more detail below.
